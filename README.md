# OpenPasswd

A secure, terminal-based password manager built with Go. Store and manage your passwords locally with end-to-end encryption.

> [!WARNING]
> Openpasswd is still under development and currently in a pre‑alpha phase. Do not use it in production.

## Installation

### Quick Install (One-Liner)

Install directly from GitHub using curl:

```bash
YOLO 
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r2unit/openpasswd/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- Clone the repository automatically
- Build the binary
- Install to `/usr/local/bin`
- Create convenient aliases (`openpass` and `pw`)
- Set up shell completions for bash and zsh

### Using Install Script (Alternative)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/r2unit/openpasswd.git
cd openpasswd

# Run install script
./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/r2unit/openpasswd.git
cd openpasswd
go build -o openpasswd ./cmd/openpasswd

# Move to your PATH (optional)
sudo mv openpasswd /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize configuration
openpasswd init

# Add a password
openpasswd add

# List passwords
openpasswd list

# Configure settings (MFA, passphrase, etc.)
openpasswd settings set-totp
openpasswd settings set-passphrase
```

## Usage

### Commands

- `openpasswd init` - Initialize configuration and database
- `openpasswd add` - Add a new password entry
- `openpasswd list` - List and search passwords
- `openpasswd settings` - Manage settings (passphrase, MFA, etc.)
- `openpasswd help` - Show help message

### Aliases

You can use these shorter commands:
- `openpass` = `openpasswd` (short alias)
- `pw` = `openpasswd` (ultra-short alias)

## Proton Pass Integration

### Important: No Public API Available

Proton Pass **does not provide a public API** for third-party integrations. The only supported method for integration is via export files.

### How to Sync from Proton Pass

1. **Export from Proton Pass**:
   - Open Proton Pass (browser extension or web app)
   - Go to Settings → Export
   - Choose your export format:
     - **PGP-encrypted ZIP** (recommended, most secure)
     - **Unencrypted ZIP**
     - **CSV**

2. **Import to OpenPasswd**:
   ```bash
   openpasswd auth login
   # Select "Proton Pass" from the provider list
   # Enter the path to your export file
   # Enter passphrase (if encrypted)
   ```

### Supported Export Formats

- **JSON** - Proton Pass JSON export (unencrypted)
- **CSV** - Simple CSV export
- **ZIP** - ZIP archive containing JSON or encrypted data
- **PGP** - PGP-encrypted export (requires `gpg` installed)

### Why No Live API Sync?

Proton Pass uses end-to-end encryption where all encryption happens client-side. They deliberately do not expose a public API to maintain security and privacy. The export feature is the official and recommended way to migrate or backup your passwords.

### Research References

- [proton-pass-common repository](https://github.com/protonpass/proton-pass-common) - Internal library, not a public API
- [Proton WebClients repository](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients) - Official clients source code
- All Proton Pass clients use private, undocumented APIs for internal use only

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/openpasswd/`:

- `salt` - Encryption salt (base64 encoded)
- `passwords.db` - Encrypted password database (SQLite)
- `passphrase` - Master passphrase (optional, encrypted)
- `totp_secret` - TOTP secret for 2FA (optional)
- `yubikey_challenge` - YubiKey challenge (optional)
- `config.toml` - Color configuration

## Security

- **Encryption**: All passwords are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and SHA-256
- **Secure Storage**: Database files stored with 0600 permissions
- **Token-Based Auth**: JWT-like tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **No Third-Party Deps**: Reduces attack surface

## Supported Password Managers

### Currently Supported ✅

- **Proton Pass** - Via export file only (no public API available)
  - Formats: JSON, CSV, ZIP, PGP-encrypted
  - Supports: Logins, Secure Notes, Credit Cards, Identities, TOTP
  - Export from: Settings → Export → Choose format
  - See [Proton Pass Integration](#proton-pass-integration) section below

### Future Integrations 🚧

The following password managers are planned for future implementation:

- **Bitwarden** - Has public API with OAuth support
  - Live sync possible
  - API docs: https://bitwarden.com/help/public-api/
  
- **1Password** - Has CLI and Connect API
  - Official Go SDK available
  - API docs: https://developer.1password.com/
  
- **LastPass** - CSV export only
  - No official API for third-party apps
  
- **KeePass** - File-based, no API
  - Could sync via cloud storage

**Note**: Currently, OpenPasswd focuses on local password storage with Proton Pass import capability. Additional integrations will be added based on demand and API availability.

## MFA Support

OpenPasswd supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Master Passphrase** - Simple password protection
- **TOTP (Time-based OTP)** - Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
- **YubiKey** - Hardware key authentication

Configure MFA:
```bash
openpasswd settings set-passphrase  # Set master passphrase
openpasswd settings set-totp         # Enable TOTP
openpasswd settings set-yubikey      # Enable YubiKey
```
